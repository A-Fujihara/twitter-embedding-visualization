I like cooking breakfast, but don't always feel like eating until 10 or 11a. 2. Aly will also often bake things on the weekend to serve as breakfast supplements during the week days; Apple cake, muffins, home-made granola, etc. Not sure if this counts 3.Do smoothies count as cooking?

For example, half a grapefruit as-is, plus a vegetarian sausage patty that is cooked?"
