https-pem\n\nSelf-signed PEM key and certificate ready for use in your HTTPS server.\n\nA dead simple way to get an HTTPS server running in development with no\nneed to generate the self signed PEM key and certificate.\n\n[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/watson/https-pem.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/watson/https-pem)\n[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/feross/standard)\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install https-pem\n```\n\n**Warning:** Upon installation a private key and a self signed\ncertificate will be generated inside `./node_modules/https-pem`. The\ncertificate is valid for 365 days and no attempt have been made to make\nthis secure in any way. I suggest only using this for testing and\ndevelopment where you just need an easy and quick way to run an HTTPS\nserver with Node.js.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```js\nvar https = require('https')\nvar pem = require('https-pem')\n\nvar server = https.createServer(pem, function (req, res) {\n  res.end('This is servered over HTTPS')\n})\n\nserver.listen(443, function () {\n  console.log('The server is running on https://localhost')\n})\n```\n\n### Connecting\n\nWhen connecting to an HTTPS server from Node.js that uses a self-signed\ncertificate, `https.request` will normally emit an `error` and refuse to\ncomplete the reuqest. To get around that simply set the\n`rejectUnauthorized` option to `false`:\n\n```js\nvar opts = { rejectUnauthorized: false }\n\nvar req = https.request(opts, function (res) {\n  // ...\n})\n\nreq.end()\n```\n\nIf using `curl` to connect to a Node.js HTTPS server using a\nself-signed certificate, use the `-k` option:\n\n```\ncurl -k https://localhost:443\n```\n\n## API\n\nThe `https-pem` module simply exposes an object with two properties:\n`key` and `cert`.\n\n### `pem.key`\n\nThe private key (RSA).\n\n### `pem.cert`\n\nThe certificate.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"email":"trentm@gmail.com","name":"trentm"},{"email":"w@tson.dk","name":"watson"}],"time":{"modified":"2022-06-18T22:21:57.334Z","created":"2016-04-23T00:17:53.909Z","1.0.0":"2016-04-23T00:17:53.909Z","1.0.1":"2016-04-23T00:29:26.026Z","1.0.2":"2016-04-23T00:41:22.190Z","1.0.3":"2016-04-23T11:24:57.630Z","1.0.4":"2017-05-01T12:57:41.230Z","2.0.0":"2017-12-07T22:18:05.237Z","3.0.0":"2022-05-30T11:36:24.321Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/watson/https-pem#readme","keywords":["tls","https","pem","key","keys","cert","certificate","selfsigned","self-signed","development","options","server"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/watson/https-pem.git"},"author":{"name":"Thomas Watson Steen","email":"w@tson.dk","url":"https://twitter.com/wa7son"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/watson/https-pem/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"berkmann18":true}}
